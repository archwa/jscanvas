# jscanvas

Trying out JavaScript canvas stuff. Using the HTML5 `<canvas>` element, I want to create game(s) (like Breakout, which shouldn't be very challenging, or whatever else) and visualization tools for low-level materials structures visualization (in conjunction with density functional theory).

Probably a bunch of other stuff too, but this is just a starting repository.

Also code is messy.
